# Piano Signal Generation and Noise Cancellation

This project involves generating a custom piano signal using pairs of notes from the 3rd and 4th octaves, simulating noise from a child randomly pressing keys, and performing noise cancellation using frequency domain conversion. The goal is to synthesize a song, visualize it in the time domain, and filter out noise to restore the original signal.

## Project Overview

The main components of this project include:
- Generating a song using pairs of notes from the 3rd and 4th piano octaves (left and right hand, respectively).
- Introducing noise to the song by adding random notes from the 3rd and 4th octaves.
- Visualizing the generated song in the time domain.
- Performing noise cancellation using frequency domain techniques to recover the clean song.

## Key Features

1. **Custom Song Generation**: Create your song using a set of customizable parameters, including note frequencies, start times, and durations.
2. **Noise Addition**: Simulate noise generated by random keys pressed during the song, mimicking a childâ€™s interference.
3. **Noise Cancellation**: Use frequency domain techniques to filter out the noise and restore the original song signal.
4. **Time Domain Visualization**: Plot the song signal in the time domain to observe the effects of noise and noise cancellation.

## Libraries Required

- `numpy`: For numerical computations and signal processing.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the signals in the time domain.
- `sounddevice`: For playing the generated sound signal.
